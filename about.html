      If I’m gonna be honest there isn’t really that much I’d like to say about myself, but I’ll try anyway. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Terence Bronaugh. I’m 21 years old (God, I'm getting old) from Chicago Illinois, and am currently enrolled at MSU (wait wouldn’t they already know this if they’re reading this?....whatever)! I am currently in my junior year and am aiming for a Bachelor of Arts in Games and Interactive Media. This biography is in fact being written for one of my classes in this major, and honestly, this page in particular was pretty vague on what to write here other than just “a bio with a list and an image” So, uh here’s my list of things I like:
    </p>
    <!---<div class="ImageInLine"></div>-->
    <div class="container">
      <img alt="Will Smith meme pointing towards list" src="src/images/smithImage.png">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Food.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Video Games.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sleep.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      All jokes aside, there isn’t much to say about me. I simply enjoy good eats, playing video games, and making video games (or at least attempting to for now). When it comes to skills I guess it would be my self-taught knowledge in the coding language Lua, and some basic skills in Python and C#, outside of programming I don’t really have much else going for me so thats pretty much it. In my free time im either playing games, watching youtube or looking up how to make some sub-system for a game idea I have.
    </p>

      For my Attributes, I'm also mostly at a loss here cause I'm not particularly dependable or have meticulous attention to detail, I'm just fairly honest, and once I'm interested in something I'll typically work pretty hard on learning/figuring it out. I'm also pretty good at managing my emotions I guess? it wasn't hard working in customer service despite the fact that I'm an introvert and don't like social environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Personal and Professional values are pretty simple. In my personal life, I heavily value my family, and in my work like strive for consistency. In either, I try to uphold any promises that I make.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that I didn't really type that much into this page so to apologize I’ll just leave this image here.
