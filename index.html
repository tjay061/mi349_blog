              To be honest, I had no idea what I should make for this blog of mine. Should I just talk about myself? Talk about miscellaneous topics? I was frankly at a loss (this is why I hate assignments with open-ended topics or too many choices). All that being said staying indecisive won’t really help me here so I’ll just go with a bit of a mixture of two ideas, This blog will just be my non-important opinions and mostly just on video games since that is the easiest for me to talk about anyway. But in this first post, it's time to start setting up my disclaimer, I’d say skip it if it's too boring but that sorta defeats the purpose.

                There! Now the boring part is over! Now in my next post, I’m thinking of showing my take on a game that came out fairly recently! See you there!

            <p>
              I want to preface here that I don’t think that Starfield is a bad game, but as I’ll talk about below, it IS a game held back by archaic game design, design of which hasn’t just been done before, but better in even previous Bethesda games. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Before release, I was cautiously excited about the game and very excited after Bethesda’s big gameplay presentation, but then I got the game and found myself fairly underwhelmed by the game design choices that were made. My issues with the game can be briefly summed up as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Lack of Traversal (both on land and in space)
              </li>
              <li>
                Repetitive POIs (points of interest)
              </li>
              <li>
                General Performance on above recommended specs
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When it comes to traversal I wasn’t exactly expecting something like the seamless space travel that No Man’s Sky had, but I was at least expecting space itself to at least be traversable between planets with a menu for traveling outside the solar system. However, the issue is Starfield makes its ENTIRE space traversal fast-traveling, and it's honestly my biggest issue with the game. Fast traveling in games is a great way to let players go back to areas that they’ve already been to without having to waste time trekking the way back, but Starfield uses this as its main mode of transportation, planets have an ‘orbit’ that essentially is a box your stuck in, of which you either use your ships scanner, or the map menu, to fast travel out of the solar system or to another planets orbit. Which all results in loading screen after loading screen, a constant break in immersion. It also doesn’t help that the mechanic makes the highly customizable spaceships seem pointless as you can either go back to planets straight from the map menu without even being in space, and their only real use, in general, is found within fighting other spaceships and fast traveling to systems you haven't been to before. And planetary exploration isn't much better as it is mostly walking/running/jetpacking around barren planets towards a very limited variety of POIs to interact with (this part of the game is literally advised by many to just be ignored in favor of questlines). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Another big issue is just the overall performance of the game. Without mods, the game runs at fairly low fps for even machines with specs far above the game-recommended specs. For a game that isn’t using a taxing feature like ray-tracing, I was genuinely surprised to be averaging at around 40-50 fps in cities and about 10-15 fps higher in other areas on the highest settings, and that lowering them barely improved that average. Later I would learn that for some reason the lower your general graphics settings or resolution is, the harder the game hits your CPU performance, and even tho my CPU(Ryzen 7 3700X) is above the recommended (Ryzen 5 3600X) this leads to a CPU bottleneck that caps performance. With mods to add in DLSS and further optimize the game’s preset settings, I was able to gain about 10-20fps on average across the board and finally get a mostly consistent 60 fps average, but it was upsetting that I had to mod the game to reach this performance when I can easily run Cyberpunk or Baldurs Gate at the highest settings at 80-100+ fps average.
            </p>
            <p>
              All that being said I do like Starfield, its faction questlines are a legitimate blast to go through and I’m still having fun with it, but I just can’t agree with the group of people that say it is like the  “Game of the Generation” or even game of the year, as its really bogged down by lack of innovative design, despite being marketed otherwise, and the fact that other games this year alone have just been outstanding. But that’s just my general opinion on the game. Play what you want play, and don't let others turn you away from it. People will always have differing opinions and their own reasons for them and you’ll always have yours.

              Below is a table showing how much I was personally enjoying the game in my first 30 hours of gameplay. It definitely increased over time as I started focusing on questlines, but I honestly forgot to write about it in the main post.
